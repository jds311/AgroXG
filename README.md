# AgroXG - Wheat Crop Disease Detection

This project can be divided into two parts:
- **<a href="https://github.com/pvatshal/AgroXG/tree/main/Artificial-Intelligence">AI model training and selection</a>**: This work introduces a framework for solving a well-known problem included in Precision Agriculture known as the Disease Detection problem. Here, we majorly focus to detect the diseases of Wheat crop using pre-trained EfficientNetB0 as core model for transfer learning using heavily enhanced Gray-level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM) as Input to the model.
- **<a href="https://github.com/pvatshal/AgroXG/tree/main/Cloud-Computing">Deployment of the Web-App on kubenetes cluster</a>**:
